# People App

## Problem
* The application accepts search input in a text box and then displays in a pleasing style a list of people where any part of their first or last name matches what was typed in the search box (displaying at least name, address, age, interests, and a picture).
* Solution should either seed data or provide a way to enter new users or both.
* Simulate search being slow and have the UI gracefully handle the delay.

### Technical Requirements
* A Web Application using WebAPI and a front-end JavaScript framework (e.g., Angular, AngularJS, React, Aurelia, etc.).
* Use an ORM framework to talk to the database.
* Unit Tests for appropriate parts of the application.

## Instructions
To run the app:
* `cd ./src`
* Start the api: `npm run api`
* In a new console window, start the ui: `npm start`

## Prerequisites
* dotnet core 2.2 SDK: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

## Notes
This is my first opportunity to use Angular. Therefore, I did not have time to sort out the Angular testing story and focused solely on functionality.
